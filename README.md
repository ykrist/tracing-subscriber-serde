# `tracing-serde-subscriber`

An adaptor crate which allows full serialisation of `tracing` events to any `serde`-support format.  This crate tries to serialise all the information produced by `tracing`, and the result is designed for later processing, rather than readability.

Still unsure whether I will publish this crate.
